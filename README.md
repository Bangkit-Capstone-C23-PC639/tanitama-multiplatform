# Rice Leaf Disease Classifier - Flutter App

This repository contains a Flutter project for a mobile application that classifies rice leaf diseases. The app utilizes the clean architecture pattern and employs `flutter_bloc` for efficient state management.

## Features

- Rice leaf disease classification: The app allows users to capture images of rice leaves and classifies them into various disease categories.
- Disease information: Users can access detailed information about each disease, including symptoms, prevention measures, and recommended treatments.
- User-friendly interface: The app is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable user experience.

## Technologies Used

- Flutter: A popular open-source UI framework developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
- clean architecture: A software design pattern that emphasizes separation of concerns and maintaining a clear separation between business logic and user interface.
- flutter_bloc: A state management library for Flutter that follows the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern, providing a predictable way to manage application state.
